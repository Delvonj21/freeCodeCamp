      <header>Introduction</header>
      <p>Python is a powerful, high-level programming language It was created by Guido van Rossum, and released in 1991.
<p>It is used for:</p>
<ul>
  <li>web development (server-side)</li>
  <li>software development </li>
  <li>mathematics</li>
  <li>system scripting</li>
</ul>
    </section>

    <section id="Variables" class="main-section">
      <header>Variables</header>
      <p>In Python, variables are used to store data values. Python has no command for declaring a variable.
A variable is created the moment you first assign a value to it.</p>
      <code>
        x = 5 
        y = "John" 
        print(x)
        print(y)
      </code>
      <p>Variables do not need to be declared with any particular type, and can even change type after they have been set.</p>
      <code>
        x = 4       # x is of type int <br>
        x = "Sally" # x is now of type str <br>
        print(x)
      </code>
    </section>

    <section id="Functions" class="main-section">
      <header>Functions</header>
      <p>A function is a block of code that only runs when it is called. You can pass data, known as parameters, into a function. A function can return data as a result.</p>
      <p>In Python a function is defined using the def keyword:</p>
      <code>
        def my_function():<br>
        print("Hello from a function")<br>
      </code>

      <p>To call a function, use the function name followed by parenthesis:</p>
      <code>
        def my_function():<br>
        print("Hello from a function")<br>
        my_function()
      </code>
   </section>

    <section id="Loops" class="main-section">
      <header>Loops</header>
      <p>Python has two primitive loop commands:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>while loops</li>
        <li>for loops</li>
      </ul>
      <p>With the while loop we can execute a set of statements as long as a condition is true.</p>
      <p>Print i as long as i is less than 6:</p>
      <code>
        i = 1<br>
        while i < 6:<br>
         print(i)<br>
         i += 1
      </code>
      <p>A for loop is used for iterating over a sequence (that is either a list, a tuple, a dictionary, a set, or a string).

This is less like the for keyword in other programming languages, and works more like an iterator method as found in other object-orientated programming languages.

With the for loop we can execute a set of statements, once for each item in a list, tuple, set etc.</p>
<p>Print each fruit in a fruit list:</p>
<code>
  fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]<br>
  for x in fruits:<br>
   print(x)
</code>
    </section>

    <section id="Lists" class="main-section">
      <header>Lists</header>
      <p>mylist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]</p>
      <p>Lists are used to store multiple items in a single variable.

Lists are one of 4 built-in data types in Python used to store collections of data, the other 3 are Tuple, Set, and Dictionary, all with different qualities and usage.

Lists are created using square brackets:</p>
<code>
  thislist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]<br>
  print(thislist)<br>
</code>
